# **App Name**: VerdantAI

## Core Features:

- Seed Insights: Seed Information Tool: Use a generative AI tool to provide comprehensive information about different seed varieties, including optimal planting times, expected yields, and common issues. This information will be based on publicly available agricultural data and scientific research.
- Soil Analysis: Soil Suitability Tool: Employ generative AI to analyze user-inputted soil data (texture, pH, etc.) and suggest suitable plant species for those conditions, as well as any necessary amendments.
- Planting Timeline: Interactive Planting Calendar: Allow users to input their location and target crop, and the app will display an interactive calendar indicating the optimal planting times based on historical weather data and AI-driven predictions.
- Growing Specs: Plant Requirement Profiles: Present clear and concise profiles for each plant species, detailing its light, water, nutrient, and spacing requirements. Data from open source databases.
- Smart Search: User-Friendly Search: Implement a robust search function enabling users to quickly find specific seed varieties, soil types, or planting techniques.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL 110, 75%, 40% (RGB hex #3FBF1A) for growth and nature.
- Background color: HSL 110, 20%, 95% (RGB hex #F0F8EC) to give prominence to content.
- Accent color: HSL 80, 65%, 50% (RGB hex #B3BF1A) for interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Alegreya', a serif with an elegant, intellectual, contemporary feel.
- Use flat, modern icons that visually represent different plant species, soil types, and planting techniques. All icons should share a consistent style.
- Employ a clean, card-based layout to organize plant profiles and growing tips, optimizing content discoverability. Use white space to give the composition an open and uncluttered feel.
- Use subtle transitions to highlight planting calendar dates and new content as it loads. Avoid animations that are distracting.
